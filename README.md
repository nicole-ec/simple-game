# simple-game
Objective: collect gems without falling off! The platform is made of squares that fall at random times; be sure not to get caught!

Visual assets such as the player model and collectible models were downloaded from the Unity Asset store.
The code is created with the help of Unity documentation and video tutorials.

Fairly new project that I work on during my spare time. Features that work:
- player movement
- collision between player and collectible
- falling platforms with warning beforehand
